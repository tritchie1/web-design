    <p class="me">I was born eighteen years ago in the payson hospital at precisely 7:12 PM. That is when my life started. At the age of one i learned french and played in the berlyn symphony. since then i spent about five years my life trying to be a perfect elvis impersinator I would go all over and perform shows. I then decided to start playing basketball at just 4'6" I could dunk a basketball. I beat Michael jordan in a slam dunk contest. From their I proceeded to play in the NBA for the Heat and I quickly became their best player. Then at the age of eight I decided to start playing tennis</p>
