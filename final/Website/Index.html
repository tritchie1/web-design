    <p class="introParagraph">I am currently a senior at salem hills high school. I was first introduced to coding by my cousin, who is a computer programmer, and I immediatly fell in love with it. I started with taking a computer programming class at my highschool. I was able to learn a bunch of the basics in computer programming. Once that class was over I continued teaching myself computer programming. I also started teaching myself CSS, HTML, and javascript. Once I started learning CSS and HTML I found that I love working with the front end of websites. I then took a web develop class where my skills in coding increased significantly. I will be attending SUU next year and start my degree to be a computer engineer and I hope to become very skilled and learn tons more about coding.</p>
