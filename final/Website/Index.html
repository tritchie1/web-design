    <p class="introParagraph">I was born eighteen years ago in the payson hospital at precisely 7:12 PM. That is when my life started. At the age of one i learned french and played in the berlyn symphony. since then i spent about five years my life trying to be a perfect elvis impersinator I would go all over and perform shows. I then decided to start playing basketball at just 4'6" I could dunk a basketball. I beat Michael jordan in a slam dunk contest. From their I proceeded to play in the NBA for the Heat and I quickly became their best player. Then at the age of eight I decided to start playing tennis. Tennis was surprisingly not one of my strong suites. basically I was terrible. I broke both my femurs playing tennis. I was trying to do a routine backflip serve, and I landed a little wierd. My femur popped out of my skin and hit the femur in my other leg which broke it. My recovery time was three whole days. during that three days I wrote the entire lord of the rings series in that three days. Then J.R.R Tolken robbed me. I beat the crap out of him, but because I had no use of my legs he managed to get the copy of my book.</p>
